I have an iPhone-only app with alternate icons. With the latest version submitted for App Review, it got rejected, because the reviewer couldnâ€™t change app icon when running the app (upscaled) on the iPad. I tried myself, and found the same issue. `UIApplication.shared.supportsAlternateIcons` returns false when running the app on iPad but true when running on iPhone (both running iOS/iPadOS 17 RC).

I reproduced this in a sample project (attached). If run as-is on iPadOS, the text at the top will tell, that alternate icons ARE NOT supported. If adding iPad as platform in the project inspector in Xcode and running the app again, it will show, that alternate icons ARE supported.

This was all done with Xcode 15.0 (15A240d) and the included SDK.
